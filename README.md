# UART-
This repository contains the RTL implementation and verification environment for a simple UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) protocol. Both Transmitter (TX) and Receiver (RX) are implemented in the DUT, and a SystemVerilog Testbench verifies the design using a loopback connection (TX â†’ RX).
